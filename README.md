# Data Exploration Notebooks

Everybody loves the phrase: "Data is the new petroleum", I believe that actually, data is better than petroleum.

I created this repository to train my skills with data visualization and data analysis, and to take conclusions and try to make predictions in datasets without use ML algorithms(Like i did before in many repositories).
